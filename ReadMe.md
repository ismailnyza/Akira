# Akira - Task Management Application

**Akira** is a simple task management application built using Spring Boot and Java. It allows users to create, manage, and track tasks with features like task creation, editing, viewing, and extended task details. The application is lightweight and designed for efficiency and ease of use, with robust exception handling to ensure seamless performance.

## Features

- **Create Task:** Add a new task with a title, description, and due date.
- **View Tasks:** View all tasks created by the logged-in user.
- **Get Task by ID:** Fetch a specific task using its unique ID.
- **Edit Task:** Update the task's details such as title, description, due date, and status.
- **Extended Task View:** Retrieve detailed information about a task, including associated metadata, sub-tasks, etc.
- **Exception Handling:** Handles errors such as invalid task IDs or missing fields with proper error messages.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Spring Boot with Java
- **Database:** H2 (in-memory, easily switchable to other relational databases)
- **Build Tool:** Gradle or Maven
- **API Documentation:** Swagger UI for interactive API exploration
- **Code Quality:** PMD, SpotBugs for code analysis

## Prerequisites

To get started with Akira, you'll need the following:

- **JDK 17** or higher
- **Gradle** or **Maven** (for building the application)
- **H2 Database** (optional, configured by default in-memory)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd akira
   ```

2. **Build the application:**

   If using **Gradle**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

   If using **Maven**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. **Access the API:**

   Once the application is running, you can access the API via Swagger UI for easy testing:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   ```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                      | Method | Description               |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `/api/tasks`                   | POST   | Create a new task          |
| `/api/tasks/{id}`              | GET    | Get task by ID             |
| `/api/tasks/{id}/extended`     | GET    | Get extended task details  |
| `/api/tasks/my-tasks`          | GET    | View tasks created by me   |
| `/api/tasks/{id}`              | PUT    | Edit a task                |

## Running Code Quality Checks

**PMD:**
Run the command below to check for potential issues in the code:
```bash
./gradlew pmdMain
```

**SpotBugs:**
Run the following command to identify bugs in the code:
```bash
./gradlew spotbugsMain
```

## Exception Handling

Akira handles all errors gracefully and provides clear messages in case of exceptions like invalid input, missing data, or unauthorized actions.

Example Error Response:
```json
{
  "error": "Task not found",
  "status": 404,
  "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:15:30"
}
```

## Database

The application is configured with an **H2 in-memory database** for testing and development. You can easily switch to other relational databases like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** by updating the `application.properties` file.
