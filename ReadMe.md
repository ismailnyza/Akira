# Akira - Task Management Application

Akira is a lightweight task management application built using Spring Boot and Java. It allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks with various features like extended task views, task editing, and user-based task retrieval. The application also includes robust exception handling and code quality checks.

## Features

- **Create Task**: Create a new task with attributes like title, description, and due date.
- **Get Task**: Retrieve a specific task by its ID.
- **Get Task (Extended View)**: Retrieve detailed information about the task, including subtasks, tags, and associated metadata.
- **Edit Task**: Edit a task's details such as title, description, and status.
- **View My Tasks**: View tasks that the currently logged-in user has created.
- **Exception Handling**: Proper handling of invalid inputs and errors with user-friendly responses.
- **Code Quality Tools**: PMD and SpotBugs integration to ensure the code adheres to best practices.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot with Java
- **Database**: H2 (or any relational database)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
- **Build Tools**: Gradle or Maven
- **Code Quality Tools**: PMD, SpotBugs

## Prerequisites

To get the Akira application running, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 11+
- Gradle or Maven
- An IDE (optional) for code editing
- Git for cloning the repository

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd akira
```

### Build the Application

Using Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run the Application

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Alternatively, you can run it using the JAR file after building:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/akira-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Access the Application

After starting the application, you can access the Swagger UI for API documentation and testing.

- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

## API Endpoints

### Task Management

- **Create Task**: `POST /api/tasks`
- **Get Task**: `GET /api/tasks/{id}`
- **Get Task (Extended)**: `GET /api/tasks/{id}/extended`
- **Edit Task**: `PUT /api/tasks/{id}`
- **View My Tasks**: `GET /api/tasks/my-tasks`

### Error Handling

Errors will return appropriate HTTP status codes along with descriptive error messages in JSON format.

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": "Task not found",
  "status": 404,
  "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:15:30"
}
```

## Code Quality Checks

Akira includes code quality checks using **PMD** and **SpotBugs**.

### Running PMD

To check code quality with PMD:

```bash
./gradlew pmdMain
```

### Running SpotBugs

To check for potential bugs with SpotBugs:

```bash
./gradlew spotbugsMain
```
